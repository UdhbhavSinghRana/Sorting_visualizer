# Sorting Visualizer Readme
## Overview

The Sorting Visualizer is a web-based application that allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. This project is designed to help users better understand how different sorting algorithms work and how they perform under various scenarios.

## Features

    Visualization of popular sorting algorithms, including:
        Bubble Sort
        Selection Sort
        Insertion Sort
        Merge Sort
        Quick Sort
    Adjustable array size for testing different input data sizes.
    Speed control to slow down or speed up the visualization.
    Real-time visualization of the sorting process.
    Detailed algorithm descriptions and complexity analysis.
